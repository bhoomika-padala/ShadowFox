#  Inventory Management System using GUI

A simple desktop application built with Java Swing for basic inventory management. It allows users to add, view, and delete products, as well as perform simple inventory analysis like calculating total stock value and filtering by quantity.

This project uses basic Java arrays to manage the inventory data, demonstrating fundamental programming concepts.
